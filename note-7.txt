Indexing column to optimize performance

Now, imagine you frequently run queries to find addresses in a specific city. Without an index on the "city" column, the database would need to perform a full table scan each time you execute such a query. This means it would have to examine every row in the "address" table to find the rows matching the specified city.

However, by creating an index on the "city" column, you can improve the performance of these queries. When you create an index, the database system creates a separate data structure that organizes the values of the indexed column(s) in a sorted order. In this case, the values in the "city" column would be sorted alphabetically.

For example, let's create an index on the "city" column:

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX ON "address" ("city");
After creating this index, the database system creates a data structure that looks something like this:

plaintext
Copy code
Index on "city" column
